    "\n",
    "The `ctc` function takes as input the path to the segmentation, the path to save results, and an optional parameter for the number of neighbours to use. Once executed, it will save the tracking results into the folder at `out_path` in typical [Cell Tracking Challenge format](https://celltrackingchallenge.net/datasets/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Tracktour keeps a list of the correct scales of all Cell Tracking Challenge datasets with ST segmentations available. Tracktour will warn you if it can't find the scale for your dataset. The results of 2D datasets will not be affected by scale, but it's quite important for 3D datasets. You can read the scale of each CTC dataset by looking at `More Details` under the dataset listing on the website. To set the `tracktour` scale yourself, you must interact with the `Tracker` object. See the [toy example](./toy.py) for how to do this."
